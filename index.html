        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is OLAWUMI OREOLUWA. I am currently enrolled in the ALT School's School of Engineering program, with the ALT SCHOOL ID ALT/SOE/024/0316.</p>
        <p>I joined ALT School to gain hands-on experience in engineering and to benefit from a curriculum that emphasizes practical skills and real-world applications.</p>
        <p>I'm a dedicated professional who graduated from the Department of Mining Engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, in the 2020/2021 academic session. During my time at university, I gained valuable experience through an industrial training program at Kopek Quarry in Ibadan, where I worked in the drilling and blasting section.

            In addition to my engineering background, I broadened my skill set by learning UI/UX design through Coursera. Currently, I am pursuing a career in cloud engineering, studying at AltSchool Africa, while also managing a successful dog breeding business. My diverse expertise in engineering, technology, and entrepreneurship highlights my dynamic approach to personal and professional growth.</p>
